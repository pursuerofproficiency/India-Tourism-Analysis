Analysis of International Tourist Arrivals in India (2017-2021)
Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end data analysis of international tourist arrivals in India from 2017 to 2021. The primary goal is to identify key trends, understand the impact of the global pandemic on the tourism sector, and forecast future arrival numbers.

The project demonstrates a full-stack data analysis workflow, from initial data exploration to professional dashboarding.

Methodology & Tools

This project was completed by following a structured data analysis pipeline, using the following tools at each stage:

Data Wrangling & Cleaning:

Python (Pandas): Used for loading, cleaning, and transforming the dataset.

SQL: Demonstrates the ability to use core database querying skills, which are essential for data sourcing in a professional environment.

Excel / Google Sheets / Apple Numbers: Used for quick, initial data exploration and validation.

Analysis & Modeling:

Python (Pandas): Performed data aggregation and in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Python (Scikit-learn): Built a linear regression model to predict tourist arrivals, showcasing skills in predictive analysis.

Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Altair): Used to create advanced statistical visualizations, such as scatter plots and interactive charts, to support the model's findings.

Data Presentation & Storytelling:

Tableau Public: A professional, interactive dashboard was created to present the key insights and findings in a visually compelling way.

Key Findings

Overall Trend: Tourist arrivals showed a consistent growth trend from 2017-2019, followed by a severe decline in 2020 due to the global pandemic, with a modest recovery beginning in 2021.

Top Contributors: [Your key findings from the analysis, e.g., "North America and South Asia were consistently the largest sources of tourism and showed the most significant rebound in 2021."]

Predictive Model: The predictive model demonstrated a strong correlation between pre- and post-pandemic arrival numbers (R-squared score of 0.71), suggesting that historical data is a significant indicator of a market's resilience.
